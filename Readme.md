# How to add a column that behaves like a radio group


<p>Actually, each <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridView">GridView's</a> cell contains its own inplace editor.  Each cell can contain several radio group items and you can select different items in different cells.
